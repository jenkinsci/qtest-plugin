# qTest Jenkins Plugin

qTest by Tricentis now integrates seamlessly with Jenkins, helping make your
Continuous Integration process more efficient. Click
[**here**](https://documentation.tricentis.com/qtest/od/en/content/qtest_apis/ci_integrations/jenkins_and_bamboo_integration.htm)
to access the qTest Integration with Jenkins user guide.  

When creating builds in Jenkins, your JUnit test results can be sent
directly to your [qTest Test Case
Management](https://www.qasymphony.com/testing-platform/qtest-case-management/) software as
test runs and test logs. This lets your team review the quality of your
build process over time and across different environments, helping you
quickly identify problem areas.
